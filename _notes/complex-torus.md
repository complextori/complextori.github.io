title: Complex Tori
---

A **complex torus** of dimension $g$ is a complex manifold $V / \Lambda$ where $V$ is a finite-dimensional vector space and $\Lambda$ is a lattice in $V$, i.e. a free abelian group with the natural map $\Lambda \otimes \mathbb{R} \to V$an isomorphism.

A complex torus is compact, connected, and has a natural group structure. Conversely, a compact, connected complex manifold with a group structure is a complex torus.

The group of line bundles on a complex torus is naturally an extension of a discrete group by a complex torus. 

We can think of line bundles on complex torus in terms of easy linear algebra data.
